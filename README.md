#### We'll Continue with the Metrics Bounce Rate And Retention Rate

Since the bounce rate of the app is good enough, the next question to ask is, do these users stay back on this app for more? Answering this is gives birth to the Retention Rate

Retention Rate gives a number to the percentage of users who still use an app a certain number of days after install.
